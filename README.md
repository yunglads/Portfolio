Stones of Cataria: Talewinds is an RPG intended for kids. With simple inventories, quests, and a dungeon system, Talewinds aims to be a less complex RPG that is story driven so it's easy for kids to pick up but also interesting enough for adults to play. Players will wake up in the free lands of the Winds with no recollection of how they got there or who they are. Someone is leaving notes(Quests) for you and as you pick them up you slowly start to get an idea of where you are and who you are. Talewinds is a personal project of mine that is currently still in development with no set release date.
