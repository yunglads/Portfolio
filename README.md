## About me
Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Aladdin Vicuna. I am a Game Designer/Developer and a Full Sail University alumni. I graduated on October 4th, 2019, with a BS in Game Design. During my time at Full Sail I've learned a lot about the gaming industry and gaming as a whole. I have always loved the idea of creating video games and with the help of Full Sail, I am able to pursue my dreams of making my game ideas come to life.

The primary gameplay involves: PvP - in which players drop what they are carrying on death, thus encouraging the players to hunt each other along with the map’s loot. PvE - involves monsters hunting the player and vice versa. Monsters will also drop loot at varying rates depending on the monster killed (higher level monsters drop higher level loot). Currently Deceason is in active development by Passion7 LLC where I am contracted as a remote game designer and is set to make an alpha release June 2020
